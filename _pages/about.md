* I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [chair of information theory and machine learning](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik/ifn/itml/die-professur/inhaber?set_language=en) at [Technische Universität Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/#)
* I received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the [Hochschule Furtwangen University](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/) in 2010, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/) in 2012 and the Dr.-Ing. (PhD) degree in electrical engineering from the Technische Universität Berlin in 2018

 
## Research 
 * I am generally interested in the topics:
    * Information theory, Security, Fairness, Machine learning, Deep learning, and Statistics
    
 * In particular I am interested in:
    * Diffusion models for wireless communication and secure wireless communication
    * Graph neural networks for multi-user networks to enable diversity gains
    * Interplay between classical codes and DL generated coding schemes
    * Fairness in machine learning and its interplay with information theory and information theoretic security
    * Estimation methods for mutual information
    * Novel security metrics for neural network based communication techniques


## Recent News
* January, 2023. My recent paper on "Learning End-to-End Channel Coding with Diffusion Models" co-authored with Muah Kim and Rafael Schaefer got accepted
* January, 2023. I have started working at TU Dresden
* December, 2022. My recent paper on "Concatenated Classic and Neural (CCN) Codes: ConcatenatedAE" co-authored with Onur Günlü and Rafael Schaefer got accepted
* Februar, 2022. I have started working at Uni Siegen
* Oktober, 2019. I have started working at FU Berlin
