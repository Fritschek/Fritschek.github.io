I am a research scientist/postdoc at the [chair of information theory and machine learning](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik/ifn/itml/die-professur/inhaber?set_language=en) at [Technische Universität Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/#) where I work at the intersection of information theory and ML.
I did my Dr.-Ing. (PhD) at the Technische Universität Berlin advised by [Gerhard Wunder](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=I9ifRZEAAAAJ&hl=de). My thesis was about deterministic models for capacity approximations in interference networks and physical layer security. I received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/) in 2012 and the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the [Hochschule Furtwangen University](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/) in 2010.

## Research 
I am generally interested in the topics of Information theory, Security, Fairness, Machine learning, and Statistics.
My research spans the following topics:
  * Information theory: Investigating the theoretical limits of data compression and transmission
  * High-dimensional statistics: Exploring estimation methods and theoretical properties in high-dimensional spaces, particularly for applications in AI
  * AI applications in wireless: Diffusion models, Interplay between classical codes and AI coding schemes
  * Estimation methods for mutual information
