* I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html) at [Freie Universit채t Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html)
 * I received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the [Hochschule Furtwangen University](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/) in 2010, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the [Technische Universit채t Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/) in 2012 and the Dr.-Ing. (PhD) degree in electrical engineering from the Technische Universit채t Berlin in 2018
 * I am generally interested in the topics:
    * Information theory (especially in network information theory)
    * Security (information theoretic security and privacy)
    * Machine learning (related to communications and estimation)
    * Deep learning (related to communications and estimation)
    * Statistics
 
## Funding
* I am a principal investigator of the DFG-funded project "Machine Learning for Physical Layer Security"
 (joint project with [Rafael Schaefer](http://www.user.tu-berlin.de/rafaelfs/) from [TU Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/))
 
 * We are looking into:
    * Applications of the latest deep learning techniques for secure wireless communication
    * Estimation methods for mutual information
    * Novel security metrics for neural network based communication techniques


## Recent News
* Oktober, 2019. I have started working at FU Berlin
