## Overview
Im generally interested in the topics (network) information theory, physical layer security,
machine learning and deep learning.
During my Ph.D., I have focused on constant-gap capacity approximations with deterministic models,
interference alignment techniques for multi-user networks and physical layer security. Now, I am
looking into deep learning applications for wireless communication and physical layer security.
Moreover, I am interested in efficient mutual information estimation and alternative security metrics.
